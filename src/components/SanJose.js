                    Three months in and you invited me over <br />
                    “Come stay with me at my parents’ house over summer.” <br />
                    I had my doubts but my little ghosts say, <br />
                    “This is the slowest you’ve taken with a boy anyway.” <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    So, I packed my suitcase and my jokes, <br />
                    flew over to your hometown riding hope. <br />
                    This was the start of a year-long play <br />
                    when I first met you, <i>San Jose</i>. <br />
                    We were soulmates, <i>San Jose</i>. <br />
                    <br />

                    So, the days had turned us into certified gamers, <br />
                    and the nights were when we whispered love to each other. <br />
                    But most times, we would just argue for days and days. <br />
                    The truth’s for the realists, so I got high on your lies anyway. <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Once, you threw away my suitcase and my keeps, <br />
                    SCREECHING at me while I hid under the sheets. <br />
                    Tears attended to me as I realized I needed to… leave. <br />
                    I needed to leave <i>San Jose</i>. <br />
                    But we were soulmates, <i>San Jose</i>. <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    …And, I remember this action-adventure game we were playing. <br />
                    We climbed to the highest tower, <br />
                    and we could almost see the escape, <br />
                    but, the final boss burned down the bridge, <br />
                    and summoned his army. <br />
                    After we’d killed all his minions, <br />
                    and the rat devil showed up smiling, <br />
                    I remember thinking… <br />
                    He looked just like you. <br />
                    .<br />
                    .<br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    …And, now that we are oversharing, <br />
                    There is something I could never get to admitting. <br />
                    That one time you almost jumped off the dorm building <br />
                    was the time I fell back in love with you truly. <br />
                    As you were curled up in my arms crying <br />
                    about how you wanted to stop existing, <br />
                    I saw someone as crazy and broken as me. <br />
                    And that was the first and the only time <br />
                    I felt like I deserved love from someone, <br />
                    and that they loved me. <br />
                    I knew no one else was going to love me. <br />
                    <br />

                    No one else is going to love me. <br />
                    <br />
                    No one else is going to love me. <br />
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Three months in and you invited me over <br />
                    “Come stay with me in <i>San Jose</i> over summer.” <br />
                    <br />

                    I knew no one else was going to love me. <br />
                    <br />

                </p>
